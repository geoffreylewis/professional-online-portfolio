# Professional Online Portfolio

## Software Summary

I finally built my professional portfolio to showcase my experience and skills in the web development arena.  I designed it with a mobile-first layout in mind, and then I created two media queries to account for screen sizes 768px and 1024px.

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Sass

## Additional Notes

* All of the HTML/CSS code has been successfully run through the W3C HTML/CSS validators; there are no errors.
* I downloaded the normalize.css reset file from https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/, converted it to a .scss file, and placed it in the "base" folder.
* I wrapped my email address in multiple span tags so as to prevent email scraping/harvesting from spammers.
* I ended up converting all of my CSS into Sass; the transition was slow but smooth.
* Originally, a lot of my CSS styles were in px units; I eventually converted almost all of them to percentages or em units.
